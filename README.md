R scripts and datasets for MFCM article

The file "MFCM_Functions_V2.R" is the main file that contains all the R functions to implement the method in the article Demirhan, H., Mixed fuzzy c-mean clustering, Under Review.

The folder "distMats" has all the distance matrices with the generalized Minkowski distance.

The folder "mixDist" has all the distance matrices with the proposed distance metrics.

The folder "datasets" contains 20 real datasets used for the experiments in the article.

The file "datasetX_codes.R" contains the R scripts to run the experiments with dataset number X.

The folder "benchmarkMethodsCodes" contains folders to implement the FCMD of D’Urso and Massari (2019), the ensembleFC of Suguna and Selvi (2012), and ADFCM of Amir and Lipika (2005).
